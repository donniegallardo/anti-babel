# anti-babel

There are [plenty of projects](TODO:link) to translate es6 syntax to older syntaxes.
This allows you to write modern syntax and run on 'old machines'.

This project is opposite (hence anti- in the name), it shell help you to port 
old code base to new code base if you have new machines and 
probably want more readable and nicer codes.

## Background
We are writing JavaScript from 'dark ages' (somewhere 19XX), and 
we are running big projects, this means we have to maintain them,
for ages sometimes.

This could help to modernize them into something more readable today.

## Goal

Provide tools/procedures/guidelines for refactoring old syntaxes and patterns to something new.

- functional programing
- es5,6 APIs
- es6 syntax
- ...
